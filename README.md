• Designed 16 bit computing system with 8 16-bit registers, 64-kB RAM to execute 14 different instructions

• Documented procedural steps for instructions, comprehensively deduced state equivalence for various steps,
reducing complexity by 40% and created the Finite State Machine diagram with 16 executable states

• Synthesized ALU, Instruction Memory, integrated using VHDL, created Testbench to test and debugging
